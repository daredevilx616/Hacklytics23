# Project Title: Awareness about Lead Poisoning

## Introduction
Lead poisoning is a serious and widespread health issue that affects people all over the world, but it receives far less attention and resources compared to other global problems like climate change. The purpose of this project is to raise awareness about the dangers of lead poisoning and educate the public on the steps they can take to protect themselves and their families.

## Problem Statement
Lead poisoning can cause a range of health problems, including developmental delays in children, reduced IQ, and behavioral problems. In some cases, it can also cause serious and life-threatening health issues such as seizures, coma, and death. Despite these dangers, lead poisoning remains a largely under-recognized and under-resourced problem, with many people being unaware of the dangers it poses and the steps they can take to protect themselves.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:

- Raise awareness about the dangers of lead poisoning
- Educate the public on the sources of lead and how it can enter the body
- Provide information on the steps people can take to protect themselves and their families from lead poisoning
- Encourage people to take action to reduce their exposure to lead and to advocate for greater resources to be directed towards addressing this issue

## Conclusion
Lead poisoning is a serious and under-recognized health issue that affects people all over the world. By raising awareness and educating the public about the dangers of lead poisoning, and the steps they can take to protect themselves and their families, we can help to reduce the incidence of this disease and improve public health.
